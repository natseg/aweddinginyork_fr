Where: The Hospitium, Museum Gardens, York UK, When: Saturday 4th May, 2019

Currently, the only thing we are sure of is that we will get married in York.
And probably not in the height of summer.
We have a few venues in mind and will update this page as soon as possible.

The 14th century Hospitium is a two-storey listed building set within the beautiful York Museum Gardens in York city centre, overlooked by the striking ruins of the Grade 1 listed St. Maryâ€™s Abbey.

It's only a short walk from the train station, and even closer to the bus stop outside the gardens.
